// Package flagx provides helpers/extensions for the [flag] package of the stdlib.
//
// Use those helpers with [flag.Var] and [flag.FlagSet.Var].
//
// Any type/function without documentation is considered work
// in progress and that part of the API may break. (But note that
// contributing high quality documentation and increasing code coverage
// by tests (including runnable examples) is a good way to fix that).
